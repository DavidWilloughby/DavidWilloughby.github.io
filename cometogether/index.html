<div class="about">
<div class="col2">
<h2 id="about">What is <span id="logo">ComeTogether</span>?</h2>
<p>CT works by connecting small groups of English learners with skilled mentors in their local area. Group members use the CT smartphone app designed to facilitate learner-directed study and come to the weekly meet prepared to talk about that week’s topic.</p>

<h3>How is it different?</h3>
<p>CT enables learner-directed study so topics are always relevant to students’ own lives. Students prepare in advance but also receive feedback on their listening and asking habits, helping them to become better social interactors.</p>

<h3>What level of English is required?</h3>
<p>CT is for people who have a good knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary and who want to improve their spoken interaction. It’s not suitable for beginners, and you'll need to demonstrate a basic ability to hold a conversation in English before you join.</p>

<h3>How can I join?</h3>
<p>First, check if there is a group in your local area. If there isn’t, you can request one by teaming up with at least one other learner. To join a group, you’ll need to pay the monthly membership fee and download the CT smartphone app.</p>
