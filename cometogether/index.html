<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>What is ComeTogether?</h3>
<p id="smalltext">CT began life in Tokyo as an innovative way to master English communication. Doing away with expensive classrooms and sales teams, CT connects small societies of English learners with highly skilled mentors in their local area.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p id="smalltext">Members meet every week to apply new learning in a social setting. They use the CT smartphone app designed to facilitate learner-directed study and come to the weekly meet prepared to talk about that week’s topic.</p>

<h3>How is it different?</h3>
<p id="smalltext">CT is mostly learner-directed so topics are directly relevant to students’ own lives. Students prepare lessons in advance but also receive feedback on their listening and asking habits, helping them to become better social interactors.</p>

<h3>What level of English is required?</h3>
<p id="smalltext">CT is for people who have a good knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary and who want to improve their spoken interaction. It’s not suitable for beginners, and you'll need to demonstrate a basic ability to hold a conversation in English before you join.</p>

<p id="bold">How can I join?</p>
<p id="smalltext">First, check if there is a society in your local area. If there isn’t, you can request one by teaming up with at least one other learner. To join a society, you’ll need to pay the monthly membership fee and download the CT smartphone app.</p>
