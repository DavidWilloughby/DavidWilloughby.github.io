<div class="about">
<h3>What is ComeTogether?</h3>
<p>ComeTogether started life in the Setagaya area of Tokyo as an innovative new way to master English communication. Instead of expensive classrooms and sales teams, CT connects small societies of English learners with highly skilled mentors in their local area.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Members meet every week to apply new learning in a social setting. They use the CT smartphone app designed to facilitate learner-directed study and come to the weekly meet prepared to talk about that week’s topic.</p>

<h3>How is it different?</h3>
<p>Because CT is learner-directed, topics are always directly relevant to the learner’s own life, including work, family and interests. As a result, CT members quickly become skilled at presenting themselves to others in an English-speaking environment. Members also receive feedback on their listening and asking habits, helping them to become better social interactors as well.</p>

<h3>What level of English is required?</h3>
<p>CT is for people who have a good knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary and who want to improve their spoken interaction. It’s not a suitable programme for beginners, and you will need to demonstrate a basic ability to hold a conversation in English before joining one of our societies.</p>

<h3>How can I join?</h3>
<p>First, check if there is a society in your local area. If there isn’t a society in your local area, request one by teaming up with at least one other learner. To join a society, you’ll need to pay the monthly membership fee and download the CT smartphone app.</p>
