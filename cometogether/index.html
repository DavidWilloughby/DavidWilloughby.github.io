<div class="about">
<div class="col2">
<h2 id="about">What is <span id="logo">ComeTogether</span>?</h2>
<p>CT works by connecting English learners with other learners and mentors in their local area. Learners use the CT app to expand their daily contact with English and prepare a weekly task that they share with others in their group.</p>

<h3>How is it different?</h3>
<p>CT promotes learner-directed study and there are no ‘lessons’. Instead, users are encouraged to meet up every week to practice what they’ve learned. There’s also the option of partnering with a mentor in order to get expert feedback on the weekly task.</p>

<h3>What level of English do I need?</h3>
<p>CT is for people who have a good knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary and who want to improve their spoken interaction. It’s not designed for beginners, and you'll need to be able to hold a basic conversation in English in order to participate.</p>

<h3>How can I use it?</h3>
<p>First, you’ll need to download the free CT app and register with one of our low-cost plans. Once registered, you’ll have access to the weekly task as well as the contact details of learners and mentors in your area.</p>
